Create a contextual dropdown menu component for the conversation menu items on the left of the screen

Requirements:

Only two menu options: "Rename" and "Delete"

The buttton causing the menu to appear (Horizontal Ellipsis like â€¦ ) appears on the right of the item when hovering over it. 

The menu should be visually distinct and clear, following modern UI best practices (e.g., Material, minimal shadow, good spacing, accessible) . Follow the existing Tailwind theme/styles

Both actions should emit events or trigger callbacks with the relevant list item ID or data: i.e. causing the renaming of the menui (that is an existing function) or delete it (a newly to be created function)


Implement it within the ccurent client side tech stack: Jinja2 templates, Tailwind, htmx and a limited amount of client side javascript
